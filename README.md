A server is a software or hardware offering a service to a user, usually referred to as client.  A hardware server is a shared computer on a network, usually powerful and housed in a data center.  A software server (often running on a hardware server) is a program that provides services to client programs or a user interface to human clients.

An Internet-connected Web server is sending a HTML file to your browser software so that you can read this page

A Web browser or browser is a program that retrieves and displays pages from the Web, and lets users access further pages through hyperlinks. 


A protocol is a system of rules that define how data is exchanged within or between computers.
Communications between devices require that the devices agree on the format of the data that is being exchanged. The set of rules that defines a format is called a protocol.

HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents.
Clients and servers communicate by exchanging individual messages (as opposed to a stream of data). The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses.


HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an encrypted version of the HTTP protocol. It uses SSL or TLS to encrypt all communication between a client and a server. This secure connection allows clients to safely exchange sensitive data with a server, such as when performing banking activities or online shopping.


A cache (web cache or HTTP cache) is a component that stores HTTP responses temporarily so that it can be used for subsequent HTTP requests as long as it meets certain conditions.


Web performance includes the server requests and responses, loading, scripting, rendering, layout, and the painting of the pixels to the screen.
